# Mulebay Marketplace
### By Sam, Cole, Beste, Alex, and Jacob

Our project is about establishing a communication hub between students on campus. 
The goal is to allow students to communicate amongst themselves on our Marketplace
so that they can sell items they no longer need. We hope to help reduce the amount of waste on 
campus at the end of every year and financial loss for students who throw
out the perfectly good items.
